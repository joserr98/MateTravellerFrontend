MateTraveler is an application designed to connect people while they are traveling. Whether you are traveling alone or with friends, this app allows you to find and connect with others who are going to the same destination. You can communicate with them through private messages, which are only visible to you and the other person.

There are two roles in this application: traveler and organizer.

As a traveler, you can join trips, message other people, edit your profile, and delete your own trips.

As an organizer, you have the same abilities as a traveler, but you also have the option to create trips so others can join you.

The admin role has all permissions and additionally has the ability to delete user accounts.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance or if you have any specific questions!
